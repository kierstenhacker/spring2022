  <p>Between the building of a new residence and dining hall, regular upkeep, the development of the Metro Purple Line and off-campus apartment and retail complexes, construction dominates the campus environment at the University of Maryland.</p>

  <p>Students at UMD know construction all too well as new projects pop up across campus on top of growing development in the College Park community. The work leads to detours around campus, closed roads, traffic congestion on U.S. 1 and noise disruptions in the early hours of the morning.</p>

  <p>“I was local coming to UMD so I kind of had an idea of what it was going to be like, but I didn't realize the scale to which the campus was consistently under construction to the point where construction would finish in one place and then it would start in a completely different place and just be a new headache,” said Willis Deitemyer, a former agricultural science and technology environmental horticulture student.</p>
  </div>

<div class="large-9 medium-12 small-12 cell">
  <p>While the construction may bring more negative consequences to students currently, Deitemyer said he thinks the investments will be worth it in 10 years, benefitting students and making the university more attractive.</p>

  <p>Most of the development is part of the <a href="https://adminvp.umd.edu/current-projects/building-greater-college-park" target="_blank">Greater College Park initiative</a>, focusing on joining the university’s Discovery District, downtown College Park and the state-of-the-art academic buildings on campus. UMD partnered with the City of College Park, Prince George’s County, the state of Maryland and public and private investors to transform the community into a booming college town.</p>

  <p>“It encompasses historic districts, up-and-coming new neighborhoods and a bustling downtown, and is welcoming a swath of amenities, including hotels, retailers, restaurants and recreation,” the <a href="https://discoverydistrict.umd.edu/Greater-College-Park#:~:text=Greater%20College%20Park%2C%20which%20encompasses,%2C%20retailers%2C%20restaurants%20and%20recreation." target="_blank">UMD Division of Administration website</a> reads.</p>

  <p>The initiative accounts for over two million square feet of development and 30 new projects funded by over $2 billion in public-private investments. <a href="https://realestate.umd.edu/current-development" target="_blank">On-campus projects</a> in the initiative include the new School of Public Policy, the Heritage Community and the E.A. Fernandez IDEA Factory, which was completed in the end of 2021. Off-campus developments include several housing complexes and office spaces for startups and collaboration.</p>

  <p>With a shortage of affordable housing in the College Park area, the Terrapin Development Company and Bozzuto are building 400 units in the Southern Gateway Project which will incorporate 62,000 square feet of retail space and outdoor space for gatherings and greenery.</p>

  <p>Other apartment and retail complexes are being built on Knox Road, U.S. 1 and near the College Park Metro Station, according to the Office of Strategic Communications.</p>

  <p>Gilbane Development Company is building the Tempo apartment complex on Route One and the Atworth complex near the College Park Metro station. Previously, Gilbane planned to build 300 units of needed graduate student housing in partnership with UMD through the Western Gateway Project. But the project was paused on Oct. 28, 2021, due to pushback from the community over environmental concerns for Guilford Woods, the area where the development would be located.</p>

  <p>However, with the investments in new off-campus housing, students living in traditional dorms have reported mold and other poor conditions. In 2018, UMD came under fire for its handling of a mold outbreak in Ellicott Hall, one of the older residence halls. Now, students still complain about humidity, floods and getting sick in older dorms.</p>

  <p>Deitemyer said in his first year he lived in Hagerstown Hall with no air conditioning among other uncomfortable living conditions. His brother also lived in Ellicott Hall at the time of the mold outbreak.</p>

  <div class="callout">
  <p>“The current conditions for a lot of students in dorms are very frustrating,” Deitemyer said. “And I think that should be an issue that's addressed first before a lot of these other things.”</p>
  </div>

  <p>The Purple Line Metro station being constructed on Adelphi Road and the <a href="https://www.mncppcapps.org/planning/publications/BookDetail.cfm?item_id=394&amp;Category_id=1" target="_blank">Adelphi Road-UMGC-UMD Purple Line Station Area Sector Plan</a> for surrounding development add to the construction on campus and the closure of roads necessary for students, faculty and staff.</p>

  <p>Since 2017, Campus Drive, which runs through the center of campus, has been limited to one lane because of Purple Line-related construction and the new “M” traffic circle. Construction of the Purple Line was delayed from opening in March 2022 to fall 2026. The project’s budget also increased to $9.28 billion from the 2016 budget, according to a <a href="https://www.purplelinemd.com/component/jdownloads/send/91-press-releases/694-board-of-public-works-approves-pl-p3-agreement" target="_blank">Maryland Department of Transportation news release</a>.</p>

</div>
  <p>Lines of orange barriers and crowds of detour signs line the roads on campus as students try to navigate through the frenzy of fences and equipment. On social media, many students have complained that the construction interferes with the beauty of the campus and adds to the general inconveniences of their days.</p> 

  <p>Junior mathematics major Eli Shillman said that the construction caused inconveniences whether it was getting woken up by the noise in the morning in his old dorm building, or now driving on U.S. 1 and around campus when trying to get to class on time.</p>

  <p>Shillman is the fourth person in his family to attend the university, and he said it makes him upset viewing their pictures knowing that the construction has changed the campus’ appearance. When he first visited UMD, his grandmother, an alumna, joined him. Shillman said she was shocked by the amount of construction.</p>

  <p>“The feel of the campus is very off,” Shillman said. “Like nothing feels nice, nowhere feels nice except like the Iribe (Center for Computer Science and Engineering).”</p>

  <p>Despite his gripes with the constant work on campus, Shillman said that he feels that the campus should be updated since it is old, even at the expense of the students.</p>

  <p>All the development in the area also poses a threat to both the environment and local small businesses that can no longer afford to stay open over larger chains. On Oct. 29, 2021, The Bagel Place, a student favorite breakfast spot, announced that it would close permanently over leasing disputes. As rent prices increase, other businesses could be at risk of shutting down.</p>

  <p>“I've lost a lot of places that I would consistently go on a night out to get food, which is frustrating,” Deitemyer said. “But I guess you just have to hope that new businesses are going to come in that are going to be as good, but it doesn't have that homey feel anymore.”</p>
