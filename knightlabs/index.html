  <p>What began as a few men yelling chants to the fans at university football games has now evolved into a roughly $2 billion dollar industry with around 4 million participants. Cheerleading, a sport that became a part of American culture, has developed into numerous styles with several companies tapping into the market. Between uniform retailers, all-star cheer gym owners and oversight companies, the business of the sport has grown tremendously since the inception of "yell squads" in the late 1800s to early 1900s. Today, the National Cheerleaders Association and the Universal Cheerleaders Association, associations formed to teach high-level cheer skills, have the most influence on the cheer world as they maintain the two main styles of cheerleading and hold various competitions. NCA style is more flashy, with a heavy influence on dance and choreography rather than aspects like a traditional cheer. The style relates closely to the style of all-star cheer teams, which differs heavily from school and youth league cheer teams. UCA style takes on the more "All American look" with simpler, clean routines including a traditional crowd cheer. Both styles incorporate the high-level skills taught for the sidelines but now competed in competitive routines. Both organizations hold competitions for all-star and school cheerleading, the most coveted being the NCA National Collegiate Championships in Daytona Beach, Florida and UCA College Nationals in Orlando, Florida. Varsity Spirit Corps. is another company with perhaps the strongest hold on the cheerleading industry. The company owns UCA and several other competition brands in addition to being one of the most popular uniform distributors, some even see the company as having a monoopolistic grab on the cheer community. Between school teams, all-star teams and NFL teams, the fame of the sport has progressed far from the initial style of cheerleading, though the traditions and stereotypes still remain. As uniforms got shorter and tighter and dance moves got more provactive, sexualization in cheerleading continued to be an issue, coinciding with harmful stereotypes despite the high level of athleticism. With the growing presence of cheerleading and all-star cheerleading on social media or television, the sport has gained more credit, however it is still at the center of debate whether it qualifies as a true sport in many eyes. The Netflix docuseries <em>CHEER </em>, which aired in 2020, brought insight into the difficulties of cheerleading, opening the eyes of the general public and changing the narrative around the age old American sport. As the industry continues to grow and develop, the original roots of spirit and skill will always be at the center of the beloved cheerleading essence.  </p>
