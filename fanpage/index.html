<h2>Haring's Rise to Fame</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="index2.html" target="_blank"> Check out some photos of Haring and his work!</a></p>

<p>Haring got his start as an artist in the New York City subways in the 1980s after moving to the Lower East Side to study painting at the School of Visual Arts in 1978. His early work came from graffiti culture where he would create white chalk drawings on black unused subway advertisement boards. It was in his subway creations where certain images and iconography became his trademark, making his work more recognizable. To this day, his symbols like the barking dog or the Radiant Baby, which became his tage to sign his subway drawings, have left a language in the legacy of his artwork. Haring then moved from commentary on the streets and in the subways to painting larger murals, paintings, and he even worked with fashion designers or popstars. Quickly becoming part of the art scene, Haring rose to high fame with his worked featured in numerous exhibits and lots of attention from the media.

<h2> Keith Haring Quotes:</h2>
</div>

<ul>
	<li>“Art should be something that liberates your soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go further.”</li>
	<li>“I am a necessary part of an important search to which there is no end.”</li>
	<li>“See, when I paint, it is an experience that, at its best, is transcending reality.”</li>
	<li>An excerpt from Keith Haring's journals:
		<br><br>
		“The public has a right to art
		The public is being ignored by most contemporary artists.
		<br>
		...
		<br>
		Art is for everybody.
		<br>
		...
		<br>
		I am interested in making art to be experienced and explored by as many individuals as possible with as many different individual ideas about the given piece with no final meaning attached. The viewer creates the reality, the meaning, the conception of the piece.”
	</li>

</ul>
