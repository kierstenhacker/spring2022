  <p> Keith Haring was born on May 4, in 1958 in Reading, Pennsylvania and was raised in Kutztown, Pennsylvania. His father, Allen Haring, was an engineer and amateur cartoonist, so Haring took an interest in drawing at a young age. He worked on creative drawings with his father, taking inspiration from Walt Disney cartoons, Dr.Seuss, Charles Schulz and the Looney Toons characters. After high school, he attended Pittsburgh's Ivy School of Professional Art to study commercial art, but lost interest after two years. He decided to focus on his own art and then took up a maintenance job at the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts where he was inspired by the work of other famous artists of the time. From working maintenance, Haring moved to New York City where he rose to fame in the widely popular art scene of the 1980s. </p>

<h3>Keith Haring Quotes</h3>
  <div class= "sidebar_content">
  <ul>
  <li>“Art should be something that liberates your soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go further.”</li>
  <li>“I am a necessary part of an important search to which there is no end.”</li>
  <li>“See, when I paint, it is an experience that, at its best, is transcending reality.”</li>
  <li>An excerpt from Keith Haring's journals:
    <br><br>
    “The public has a right to art
    The public is being ignored by most contemporary artists.
    <br>
    ...
    <br>
    Art is for everybody.
    <br>
    ...
    <br>
    I am interested in making art to be experienced and explored by as many individuals as possible with as many different individual ideas about the given piece with no final meaning attached. The viewer creates the reality, the meaning, the conception of the piece.”
  </li>
</ul>

   <p>Haring got his start as an artist in the New York City subways in the 1980s after moving to the Lower East Side to study painting at the School of Visual Arts in 1978. His early work came from graffiti culture where he would create white chalk drawings on black unused subway advertisement boards. It was in his subway creations where certain images and iconography became his trademark, making his work more recognizable. To this day, his symbols like the barking dog or the Radiant Baby, which became his tage to sign his subway drawings, have left a language in the legacy of his artwork. Haring then moved from commentary on the streets and in the subways to painting larger murals, paintings, and he even worked with fashion designers or popstars. Quickly becoming part of the art scene, Haring rose to high fame with his worked featured in numerous exhibits and lots of attention from the media.</p>
